Google AdSense Integration Guide for TempMail Pro

1. AdSense Application Requirements:
   - Website must be at least 6 months old
   - Have unique, high-quality content
   - Follow AdSense program policies
   - Have privacy policy and terms of service pages (already implemented)
   - Clear navigation and professional design
   - No prohibited content

2. Application Process:
   a. Go to https://www.google.com/adsense/start
   b. Sign in with your Google account
   c. Enter your website URL and contact information
   d. Wait for approval (typically 1-2 weeks)

3. After Approval:
   a. Get your AdSense code
   b. Add it to the site by creating a new component:

   src/components/AdUnit.tsx:
   ```tsx
   export default function AdUnit({ slot }: { slot: string }) {
     useEffect(() => {
       try {
         (window.adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
       } catch (e) {
         console.error('AdSense error:', e);
       }
     }, []);

     return (
       <ins
         className="adsbygoogle"
         style={{ display: 'block' }}
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" // Replace with your client ID
         data-ad-slot={slot}
         data-ad-format="auto"
         data-full-width-responsive="true"
       />
     );
   }
   ```

4. Ad Placement:
   - Already implemented ad containers in the layout
   - Use the AdUnit component in these locations
   - Follow AdSense guidelines for ad placement
   - Don't place ads too close to navigation or interactive elements

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Load ads asynchronously
   - Monitor site speed after ad implementation
   - Use lazy loading for below-the-fold ads
   - Don't overload pages with too many ads

6. Compliance:
   - Update privacy policy to mention ad tracking
   - Include cookie consent if required by your jurisdiction
   - Follow GDPR requirements if serving EU users

7. Optimization:
   - Test different ad sizes and placements
   - Monitor CTR and revenue in AdSense dashboard
   - A/B test ad positions
   - Use auto ads for optimal placement

Remember:
- Keep content high-quality and updated
- Monitor site performance
- Follow all AdSense policies
- Don't click your own ads
- Be patient with earnings growth
